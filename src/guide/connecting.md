# Connecting

The first step is to construct the SDK configuration. Among others, it sets the network you want to use and the SDK working directory.

The SDK uses the config `working_dir` to store the state of the SDK instance. When handling multiple instances of the SDK, each instance needs to have a different working directory defined.

Now you are ready to interact with the SDK.

<h4>Developer note</h4>

By default, the config working directory is set to `./.data`. Some platforms may require that you use an application specific directory that is writable within the application sandbox. For example applications running on Android or iOS.

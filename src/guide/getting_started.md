- **[Listening to events](/guide/events.md)**

## API Key

The _Nodeless_ Breez API key must be set for the SDK to work. You can request one for free by filling our form <a target="_blank" href="{{api_key_form_uri}}">here</a>.

**Note:** This is not the same as the _Native_ (Greenlight) Breez API key, so it can't be reused.

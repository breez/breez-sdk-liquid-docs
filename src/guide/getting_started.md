# Getting Started

Integrating Breez SDK - Nodeless *(Liquid Implementation)* into your application takes just a few minutes. Follow these steps to get started:
- **[Installing the SDK](/guide/install.md)**
- **[Connecting](/guide/connecting.md)**
- **[Fetching the balance](/guide/wallet_state.md)**
- **[Listening to events](/guide/events.md)**
- **[Adding logging](/guide/logging.md)**

## API Key

The _Nodeless_ Breez API key must be set for the SDK to work. You can request one for free by filling our form <a target="_blank" href="{{api_key_form_uri}}">here</a>.

**Note:** This is not the same as the _Native_ (Greenlight) Breez API key, so it can't be reused.

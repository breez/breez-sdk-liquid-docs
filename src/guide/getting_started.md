# Getting started

The Breez SDK enables mobile developers to integrate Lightning and bitcoin payments into their apps with a very shallow learning curve. The use cases are endless â€“ from social apps that want to integrate tipping between users to content-creation apps interested in adding bitcoin monetization. Crucially, this SDK is an end-to-end, non-custodial, drop-in solution powered by Liquid, on-chain interoperability, third-party fiat on-ramps, and other services users and operators need.

The Breez SDK provides the following services:

* Sending payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, keysend, lnurl-pay, lightning address, btc address, etc.)
* Receiving payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, lnurl-withdraw, btc address, etc.)
  
## Pricing

The Breez SDK is free for developers.

## Installing

Breez Liquid SDK is available in several platforms. Follow the [Installing](guide/install.md) page for instructions on how to install on your platform.

## Connecting

The first step is to construct the SDK configuration. Among others, it sets the network you want to use and the SDK working directory.

The SDK uses the config `working_dir` to store the state of the SDK instance. When handling multiple instances of the SDK, one per node, each needs to have a different working directory defined.

Now you are ready to interact with the SDK.

<h4>Developer note</h4>

By default, the config working directory is set to `./.data`. Some platforms may require that you use an application specific directory that is writable within the application sandbox. For example applications running on Android or iOS.

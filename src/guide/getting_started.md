# Getting Started

Integrating Breez SDK - Liquid into your application takes just a few minutes. Follow these steps to get started:
- **[Installing the SDK](/guide/install.md)**
- **[Connecting](/guide/connecting.md)**
- **[Fetching the balance](/guide/wallet_state.md)**
- **[Listening to events](/guide/events.md)**
- **[Adding logging](/guide/logging.md)**
- **[Custom configuration](/guide/configuration.md)**

## API Key

The Breez SDK API key must be set for the SDK to work. You can request one by filling our form <a target="_blank" href="{{api_key_form_uri}}">here</a>.

**Note:** This is not the same as the _Native_ (Greenlight) Breez API key, so it can't be reused.

## UX Guidelines

When implementing the Breez SDK, we recommend reading through our [UX Guidelines](/guide/uxguide.md) to provide a consistent and intuitive experience for your end-users.

Many of the guidelines are implemented in [Misty Breez](https://github.com/breez/misty-breez/), which you can use as the primary UX reference during SDK implementation.
